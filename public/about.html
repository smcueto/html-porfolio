<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there, my name is Stephanie Michelle Cueto and I am Web Developer.</p>
<Developer class="emoji">&#128105; &#8205; &#128187;</Developer>

<p>Playing with code at an early age and working in the Education Non-profit Sector led to my interest in becoming a Web Developer in 2016.</p>

<p>In my downtime I like to organize my home (love maximizing space), talking or listening to podcasts relating to psychology (Savvy Psychologist anyone?), working on coding projects (Javascript is pretty cool!), or travel to different cities!</p>
